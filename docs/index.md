## What is annuity-pricing?

A research-focused Python library for pricing and analyzing annuity products:

- **MYGA** (Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuity) — Present value calculations with guaranteed rates
- **FIA** (Fixed Indexed Annuity) — Option budgeting with caps, participation rates, and spreads
- **RILA** (Registered Index-Linked Annuity) — Buffer/floor protection with market participation
- **GLWB** (Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit) — Monte Carlo valuation of living benefits

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Risk-Neutral Pricing** | Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo engines with proper drift |
| **Cross-Validated** | Verified against financepy, QuantLib, and Hull textbook examples |
| **Regulatory Prototypes** | VM-21/VM-22 reserve calculations (beta) |
| **Behavioral Models** | Dynamic lapse, withdrawal efficiency, expense loading |
| **Research-Grade** | Type hints, frozen dataclasses, 2470+ tests (6 skipped) |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install annuity-pricing
```

For development with validation dependencies:

```bash
pip install annuity-pricing[validation]
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from annuity_pricing.products.fia import FIAPricer, MarketParams
from annuity_pricing.data.schemas import FIAProduct

# Set up market conditions
market = MarketParams(
    spot=100.0,
    risk_free_rate=0.05,
    dividend_yield=0.02,
    volatility=0.20,
)

# Price an FIA with 10% cap
fia = FIAProduct(
    company_name="Example Life",
    product_name="S&P 500 Cap",
    product_group="FIA",
    status="current",
    cap_rate=0.10,
    index_used="S&P 500",
)

pricer = FIAPricer(market_params=market)
result = pricer.price(fia, term_years=1.0, premium=100_000)

print(f"Expected Credit: {result.expected_credit:.2%}")
print(f"Present Value: ${result.present_value:,.0f}")
```
