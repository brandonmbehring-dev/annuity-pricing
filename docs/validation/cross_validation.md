## Adapter Tests

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_adapters.py -v
# 19 passed, 4 skipped
```

| Adapter | Tests | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| FinancepyAdapter | 7 | ✅ PASSED |
| QuantLibAdapter | 7 | ✅ PASSED |
| PyfengAdapter | 4 | ⚠️ SKIPPED (scipy compatibility) |

## Running Validation

```bash
# Install validation dependencies
pip install annuity-pricing[validation]

# Run adapter tests
pytest tests/unit/test_adapters.py -v

# Run validation notebooks
jupyter nbconvert --execute notebooks/validation/options/*.ipynb
```

## Known Issues

### pyfeng scipy compatibility

pyfeng uses `scipy.misc.derivative` which was removed in scipy 1.12+.
Tests are skipped until upstream fix is available.
