"""
GLWB Withdrawal Utilization Model - Phase 7 + Phase H SOA Calibration.

Models policyholder withdrawal behavior for GLWB products.
Tracks actual vs maximum allowed withdrawals.

Theory
------
[T1] Utilization rate = Actual Withdrawal / Maximum Allowed Withdrawal

Empirical patterns (from LIMRA/SOA studies):
- Average utilization: 60-80%
- Higher utilization for older ages
- Lower utilization early in contract

[T2] SOA 2018 calibration adds:
- Duration-based utilization (11% year 1 → 54% year 10)
- Age-based utilization curves
- ITM sensitivity factors (deep ITM → 2.1x utilization)
