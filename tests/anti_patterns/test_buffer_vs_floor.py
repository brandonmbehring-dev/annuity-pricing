"""
Anti-pattern test: Buffer vs Floor confusion prevention.

[T1] Buffer (RILA) and Floor (FIA) are DIFFERENT protection mechanisms.
This test ensures they are NOT confused or mixed up.

Buffer: Absorbs the FIRST X% of losses. Client exposed beyond buffer.
        Example: 10% buffer, -15% return → client loses 5%

Floor:  Minimum credited rate (always ≥ 0%). Client NOT exposed to any loss.
        Example: 0% floor, -15% return → client credited 0%, no loss

HALT if these mechanisms are confused or implemented incorrectly.

See: CONSTITUTION.md Section 1.2 (FIA), Section 1.3 (RILA)
See: docs/knowledge/domain/buffer_floor.md
