## Edward Jones Platform Philosophy

### Why Limited MYGA Selection?

Edward Jones deliberately maintains a narrow product shelf:

1. **"Relatively straightforward"** - Avoids complex products
2. **6 carriers** vs. 20-30 at typical broker-dealers
3. **No Fixed Indexed Annuities (FIAs)** - Deliberate exclusion
4. **Also excludes**: Options, commodities, hedge funds, indexed UL

> *"Part of that philosophy involves not cluttering its investment platform with too many choices."*
> — Steve Rueschhoff, Principal for Insurance & Annuity Products, Edward Jones
